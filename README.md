# Welcome to Gabriel's Portfolio!

[Live Site: gflujan.com](https://gflujan.com)

This is my central hub to display projects that I've worked on, technologies that I've used, some backstory about myself, and it's got a contact form as well!

I'm a recent graduate from @AppAcademy in San Francisco and am looking for opportunities of both the educational and professional kind.

I'm also a fan of the SF Giants, SJ Sharks and metal & electronic music.

Enjoy and thanks for stopping by!
